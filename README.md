# iris-singlefeature-classification

## The Story
The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning history. Collected by British biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936, it contains measurements of three Iris flower species:
* Iris setosa
* Iris versicolor
* Iris virginica

For each flower, we have four features:
* Sepal length
* Sepal width
* Petal length
* Petal width

This dataset is often called the “Hello World” of machine learning because it’s simple, small, and yet surprisingly rich.

This project asks: 
### Can a single feature really tell us what species of flower we’re looking at?

### Why??
Because real-world machine learning isn’t always about building the most complex models. Sometimes it’s about starting simple, but asking what the minimum information needed is to make a decision. This project explores that idea in the classic Iris dataset


## Goal
The goal of this project is to test whether one feature at a time can accurately classify flowers in the Iris dataset and to find which feature performs best.


## Process
* Load the dataset.
* Pick one feature.
* Split into train/test.
* Train a simple classifier.
* Evaluate the results.


## Results
* Best single feature: 
* Accuracy:
